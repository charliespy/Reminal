// up the process tree until it meets a live agent.

// REMINAL_SESSION is the fast path and covers anything the session's shell
// starts. It is NOT enough on its own: a harness may scrub the environment of
// the helpers it spawns — cursor-agent launches MCP servers with no REMINAL_*
// variables at all — and such a helper would otherwise have no idea which
// session it belongs to, so every session-scoped tool it offers silently fails.
// The process tree still says so: the helper is a descendant of the agent that
// owns the PTY, and the agent's pid is in its own active record.
//
// Returns "" when this process is genuinely not inside a session — and when
// it runs under a probe's mark (HookProbeEnv), its own or any process's it
// meets on the way up before an agent, or one it meets is in a running
// probe's session (RunProbe): a program reminal only asks something is in no
// session, though a session's reminal started it.
