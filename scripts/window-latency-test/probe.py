# The probe window. Every key or click flips it between black and white and
# logs when the event arrived (wall clock ms, the same clock the viewer's
# container reads): input -> host latency is read from that. While
# /shared/anim exists a bar moves along its top edge every 16 ms, so the
# window changes continuously: delivered frame rate and jitter are read from
# that. The flip covers the centre, which the bar never reaches.
